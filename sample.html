<h1 id="ordinals-flat">ordinal’s flat</h1>
<p>a semi-fictionalised pocket place based on where I live</p>
<h2 id="why-would-i-go-there">why would I go there</h2>
<ul>
<li>you are me and have lost your keys and also your memory apart from that you live there</li>
<li>you’ve been given bad info by a deceitful supernatural entity</li>
<li>the <strong>robot vacuum</strong> needs to be returned to the psychological warfare lab from whence it came</li>
</ul>

<div class="page p2">
<h2 id="outside-the-block">outside the block</h2>
<ul>
<li>six storeys, nothing much on the roof</li>
<li>on a crossroads with two sides facing roads - one main road, one side road</li>
<li>main entrance with entryphone</li>
<li>side gate with lock</li>
<li>scaffolding on exterior walls</li>
<li>(alarmed, unknown quality, 1d6: 1-2=actually good, 3-4=easily bypassed if you know what you’re doing, 5-6=basically fake)</li>

<li>front door to the west</li>
<li>doorway south to living room</li>
<li>cupboard on east wall with a washing machine, fuse box, a stepladder, tins of paint, spare parts for a robot vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>the washing machine is running and looks like it will bounce right out of the cupboard, 1 in 6 chance per minute that it actually does</li>
<li>2 in 6 chance the <strong>robot vacuum</strong> is trapped here and can’t find its way out</li>

<li>monitor and gaming console possessed by the spirit of lockdown on table by east wall (playing causes paralysis)</li>

<h2 id="the-robot-vacuum">the robot vacuum</h2>
<ul>
<li>cannot be broken by acts of anger, they will at worst make it beep (see below)</li>
<li>can be distracted by shoelaces, USB cables, fringes on scarves, items of post left under the letterbox on the carpet</li>
<li>starved of and desperate for attention: will follow anyone about, tripping them up</li>
<li>if not receiving attention will pretend it has a fault and start to beep plaintively</li>
<li><strong>beeping</strong>: psychic damage to everyone hearing it each round until rescued</li>
