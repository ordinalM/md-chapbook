# ordinal's flat
a semi-fictionalised pocket place based on where I live

## why would I go there
- you are me and have lost your keys and also your memory apart from that you live there
- you've been given bad info by a deceitful supernatural entity
- the **robot vacuum** needs to be returned to the psychological warfare lab from whence it came

---

## outside the block
- six storeys, nothing much on the roof
- on a crossroads with two sides facing roads - one main road, one side road
- main entrance with entryphone
- side gate with lock
- scaffolding on exterior walls
- (alarmed, unknown quality, 1d6: 1-2=actually good, 3-4=easily bypassed if you know what you're doing, 5-6=basically fake)

---

## inside the block
- lobby behind main entrance with rickety lift and main staircase around lift shaft
- side doors from lobby
- (left: cloister around central courtyard with little garden;
- right: bins, garages, unused lockups)
- concrete walkways around each floor look down onto garden
- my flat is on the fourth floor, right in the corner, reasonably sturdy door, Yale lock, the doorbell doesn't work, the doormat is ragged now but says WELCOME
---
## the vestibule
- front door to the west
- doorway south to living room
- cupboard on east wall with a washing machine, fuse box, a stepladder, tins of paint, spare parts for a robot vacuum cleaner
- the washing machine is running and looks like it will bounce right out of the cupboard, 1 in 6 chance per minute that it actually does
- 2 in 6 chance the **robot vacuum** is trapped here and can't find its way out

---

## the living room
- doorway north to the vestibule
- doorway east to small hallway
- windows to south facing scaffolding, locked door to tiny exterior balcony facing main road
- almost entirely unused sofa
- haunted compact film cameras and unread political books on shelves by north door
- macbook pro that refuses to work when not plugged in
- walking without shoes will do damage from hard carpet nails

---

## small hallway
- north to kitchen, east to bathroom, south to bedroom
## kitchen
- tiny galleyway with cooker from the 70s and cupboards (will shower you with spices and crisps when opened)
## bathroom
- bath and shower and toilet
- high chance the ceiling is leaking and may collapse altogether

---

## bedroom
- north door to small hallway
- wardrobes, clothes
- double bed covered with a blanket covered with arcane literature, fountain pens, and camera parts. The **robot vacuum** hides things under the bed.
- south windows onto scaffolding
- (no space to open, would need to be broken to get in or out)
- monitor and gaming console possessed by the spirit of lockdown on table by east wall (playing causes paralysis)

---

## the robot vacuum
- cannot be broken by acts of anger, they will at worst make it beep (see below)
- can be distracted by shoelaces, USB cables, fringes on scarves, items of post left under the letterbox on the carpet
- starved of and desperate for attention: will follow anyone about, tripping them up
- if not receiving attention will pretend it has a fault and start to beep plaintively
- **beeping**: psychic damage to everyone hearing it each round until rescued
